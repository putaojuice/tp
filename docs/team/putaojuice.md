### Project: NUScheduler
NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `AddTask` command ([#26](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-4/tp/pull/26)).
  * What it does: Allow the user to add a task to the application with description and deadline (optional)
  * Justification: Our target audience is year 1 computing students. It helps them to keep track of their assignments
  and any other daily tasks.
  * **Classes created**:
    * `AddTaskCommand`
    * `AddTaskCommandParser`
    * `TaskList`
    * `Task`
  * **Tests written**:
    * `AddTaskCommandTest`
    * `AddTaskCommandParserTest`
    * `TaskListTest`
    * `TaskTest`
  * **Additional info**:
    * `Task` and `TaskList` classes are created to capture the information of tasks and store them as an `ArrayList` in
  `ModelManager`.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `TaskListStorage` ([#74](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-4/tp/pull/74)).
  * What it does: The system will write the task list to user's local folder in Json format whenever there is a change
  in the task list. The system will read from the saved task list from user's local folder in Json format when starting up
  to load the stored task list from the last access.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to save their task list and continue where it was left from.
  * **Classes created**:
    * `ReadOnlyTaskList`
    * `JsonAdaptedTask`
    * `JsonSerializableTaskList`
    * `JsonTaskListStorage`
    * `TaskListStorage`
  * **Tests written**:
    * `JsonAdaptedTaskTest`
    * `JsonSerializableTaskListTest`
    * `JsonTaskListStorageTest`
    * `TypicalTask`
  * **Additional info**:
    * This feature requires a good understand of how the application is designed and involves modification to
    `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage`.
