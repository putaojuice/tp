**NUScheduler is a desktop app for Year 1 Computing students to assist with more efficient management of tasks and contacts**,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, NUScheduler can schedule your tasks faster than traditional GUI apps.


* If you are interested in using NUScheduler, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUScheduler, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
